1. Which of the following is an object and which is a basic type?

*Object - String s*
*Basic types - int a, double b, int c[]*

2. A. What is a static method in Java?

   *A static method declares functions and variables that exist regardless of whether or not any instances of the class are generated.*

    B. Why does the main method need to be a static method?

    *So that you can call the main method directly, without instantiating an object instance of the class.*

3. What is the output of the following programs?

  *Program 1*
  ```
  Wrong
  ```

  *Program 2*
  ```
  Correct
  ```

4. Does the below program change the season? Why, or why not?

  *No, the season isn't changed to 'Spring'. Even though 'Winter' is passed as a parameter, the original string is not accessed.*

5. What is the output of the main method below? Please explain.

  *Output:*
```
X: 0 Y: 0 
```
  *The class variables x and y are not assigned correctly in the constructor; since the function parameter names are the same as the class variables, ```this.``` keyword should be used to differentiate. ie. ```this.x = x``` would correctly assign the parameter to the class variable.*

6. What principle of OOP does the private declaration for variable and functions achieve? Explain.

  *The ```private``` declaration for variables and functions is a visibility modifier used to limit the who can access the variable/function/object via information hiding.*

7. In the Point class below, how does Java choose between the two constructors.

  *Java supports method overloading, which means that two constructors can have the same name as long as they have different parameters. Java will use the parameters to determine which constructor to use.*

8. For the below questions, when the class Point is referenced, we are talking about the below class, 
  which you can assume is fully implemented and working as described:
  Say we want to make a class that extends Point with a method that can reflect a point across the 
  X and Y axis. Which of the following implementations achieves this? Explain why. 

  *Option 4. Since the point's x and y coordinates are privately declared inside the Parent class Point, it's necessary to call ```.get()``` functions to retrieve them, and then ```.set()``` to actually change the values.*

9. If we add this constructor to CustomPoint and then run this program, what is the output?

  *It wouldn't compile because ```super()```, the parent constructor, is called after x and y values are initialized.*

10. What if we switch line 1 and 2 in the previous question?

  *x and y will be initialized as (0,0) by the parent constructor, then set to (10,10).*

11. If we want to override sum_x_y in our custom point, but first reflect the point before returning 
the sum, which of the following implementations are valid? Explain.

  *Option 2. By sharing the same name as the parent method, it will override. Option 2 also correctly retrieves x and y with the use of ```.get()```.*

12. What is the point of the protected modifier? Why do we have it and how does it work in terms of inheritance?

  *The protected keyword allows access from sub-classes. It's a compromise between private/or complete separation of interface and implementation and risking security with all public methods.*

13. Consider the following class. Suppose we want to extend this to a FormulaOne class which has a make, 
  e.g., Mercedes. Complete the constructor and toString() method.

  ```
public class FormulaOne extends Racecar {
    private String make;

    public Racecar(int n, Driver d, String m) {
        super(n, d);
        make = m; 
    }

    public String toString() {
        return super.toString() + " Make: " + make;
    }
}

  ```

14. Using the Racecar and FormulaOne classes above, if we had a main method in a different class than 
  either of those, does the code work at mark A or mark B or neither? Explain.

  *Neither work because they are called from a different class; so the ```protected``` keyword prevents the method from being accessed.*

15. Consider the UML diagram from the notes. Expand this to include an intern. An intern is like an 
  employee, has a manager, unit, but has an expiration on their employment. How does this fit into the 
  UML diagram? Include your UML diagram and explanation below in this markdown file.
