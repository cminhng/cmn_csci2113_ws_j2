1. Which of the following is an object and which is a basic type?

*Object - String s*
*Basic types - int a, double b, int c[]*

2. A. What is a static method in Java?

   *A static method declares functions and variables that exist regardless of whether or not any instances of the class are generated.*

    B. Why does the main method need to be a static method?

    *So that you can call the main method directly, without instantiating an object instance of the class.*

3. What is the output of the following programs?

  *Program 1*
  ```
  Wrong
  ```

  *Program 2*
  ```
  Correct
  ```

4. Does the below program change the season? Why, or why not?

  *No, the season isn't changed to 'Spring'. Even though 'Winter' is passed as a parameter, the original string is not accessed.*

5. What is the output of the main method below? Please explain.

  *Output:*
```
X: 0 Y: 0 
```
  *The class variables x and y are not assigned correctly in the constructor; since the function parameter names are the same as the class variables, ```this.``` keyword should be used to differentiate. ie. ```this.x = x``` would correctly assign the parameter to the class variable.*

6. What principle of OOP does the private declaration for variable and functions achieve? Explain.

  *The ```private``` declaration for variables and functions is a visibility modifier used to limit the who can access the variable/function/object via information hiding.*

7. In the Point class below, how does Java choose between the two constructors.

  *Java supports method overloading, which means that two constructors can have the same name as long as they have different parameters. Java will use the parameters to determine which constructor to use.*

8. For the below questions, when the class Point is referenced, we are talking about the below class, 
  which you can assume is fully implemented and working as described:
  Say we want to make a class that extends Point with a method that can reflect a point across the 
  X and Y axis. Which of the following implementations achieves this? Explain why. 

9. If we add this constructor to CustomPoint and then run this program, what is the output?

10. What if we switch line 1 and 2 in the previous question?

11. If we want to override sum_x_y in our custom point, but first reflect the point before returning 
the sum, which of the following implementations are valid? Explain.

12. What is the point of the protected modifier? Why do we have it and how does it work in terms of inheritance?

13. Consider the following class. Suppose we want to extend this to a FormulaOne class which has a make, 
  e.g., Mercedes. Complete the constructor and toString() method.

14. Using the Racecar and FormulaOne classes above, if we had a main method in a different class than 
  either of those, does the code work at mark A or mark B or neither? Explain.

15. Consider the UML diagram from the notes. Expand this to include an intern. An intern is like an 
  employee, has a manager, unit, but has an expiration on their employment. How does this fit into the 
  UML diagram? Include your UML diagram and explanation below in this markdown file.
