1. Which of the following is an object and which is a basic type?
2. Two part question:
  A. What is a static method in Java?
  B. Why does the main method need to be a static method?
3. What is the output of the following programs?
4. Does the below program change the season? Why, or why not?
5. What is the output of the main method below? Please explain.
6. What principle of OOP does the private declaration for variable and functions achieve? Explain.
7. In the Point class below, how does Java choose between the two constructors.
8. For the below questions, when the class Point is referenced, we are talking about the below class, 
  which you can assume is fully implemented and working as described:
  Say we want to make a class that extends Point with a method that can reflect a point across the 
  X and Y axis. Which of the following implementations achieves this? Explain why. 
9. If we add this constructor to CustomPoint and then run this program, what is the output?
10. What if we switch line 1 and 2 in the previous question?
11. If we want to override sum_x_y in our custom point, but first reflect the point before returning 
the sum, which of the following implementations are valid? Explain.
12. What is the point of the protected modifier? Why do we have it and how does it work in terms of inheritance?
13. Consider the following class. Suppose we want to extend this to a FormulaOne class which has a make, 
  e.g., Mercedes. Complete the constructor and toString() method.
14. Using the Racecar and FormulaOne classes above, if we had a main method in a different class than 
  either of those, does the code work at mark A or mark B or neither? Explain.
15. Consider the UML diagram from the notes. Expand this to include an intern. An intern is like an 
  employee, has a manager, unit, but has an expiration on their employment. How does this fit into the 
  UML diagram? Include your UML diagram and explanation below in this markdown file.
